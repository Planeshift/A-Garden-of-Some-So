            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>This whole website was made by me, Quentin Garcia, a french web developper, starting in May of 2022. The project can be found on GitHub: <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Planeshift/A-Garden-of-Some-Sort">A Garden Of Some Sort</a>.</p>

            <p>The point was to make small self-contained "apps" that could be used both as a demonstration of skill and to acquire new ones. But more important than that, I just wanted to make… things. Pretty and silly little webpages, akin to pages you can find on <a class="link" href="https://theuselessweb.com/">The Useless Web</a>, itself an impressive collection of pages that mostly do… well, useless things. Some are dumb, some are amusing, some are beautiful, some are informative, and most, if not all, are useless beyond a few seconds of distraction. But there is something profound in how much time and craft people will pour into making those few seconds, don't you think?</p>

            <p>Moving on from this sudden philosophical turn, here are some technical details that may interest you. </p>

            <p>For a while, everything was made with plain old vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. My only concession to modernity was Gulp, to ease up some common issues and repetitive tasks. As of this writing, I have embraced the technological marvels of a new century, and I have used Vue with some additional libraries on the side to make… well, stuff. The point of this website is for me to learn more and more, so I expect I'll do some minor projects in React and Angular. However, I may have to redo this whole mess by that point, given this is all other the place.</p>

            <p>Most of what you can find of this website has been made by my little hands. However, there are exceptions, mostly sounds. You can find all credits on the <a class="link" href="./credits.html">aptly named page</a>, or by clicking the question mark button in the application bar on the right whenever it's there.</p>

            <p>If you see any bugs, wonder why I wrote things this way, have some advice about how I could write some better code or have some inquiries in general, feel free to contact me, either on GitHub or via email: <span><button id="email-button">click to reveal</button></span>.</p>
