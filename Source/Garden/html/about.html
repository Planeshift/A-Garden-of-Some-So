            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>This whole website was made by me, Quentin Garcia, a french web developper, starting in May of 2022. The project can be found on GitHub: <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Planeshift/A-Garden-of-Some-Sort">A Garden Of Some Sort</a>.</p>

            <p>The point was to made small self-contained "apps" that could be used both as a demonstration of skill and to acquire new ones. But more important than that, I just wanted to make… things. Pretty and silly little webpages, akin to pages you can find on <a class="link" href="https://theuselessweb.com/">The Useless Web</a>, itself an impressive collection of pages that mostly do… well, useless things. Some are dumb, some are amusing, some are beautiful, some are informative, and most, if not all, are useless beyond a few seconds of distraction. But there is something profound in how much time and craft people will pour into making those few seconds, don't you think?</p>

            <p>Moving on from this sudden philosophical turn, here are some technical things that may interest you. </p>

            <p>This whole thing was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript, mostly vanilla stuff: no SASS or LESS, no React or Angular or Vue, just the plain old HTML/CSS/JS combination. As of now, the only concession to modernity I made was Gulp, and that's only to do some include in my HTML files. As of now, I had no need for modern frameworks, and I'm a fan of having a very lightweight website with as few dependecies as possible. I have some projects that will use some of those new shiny frameworks, but not right now.</p>

            <p>Most of what you can find of this website has been made by my little hands. However, there are exceptions, mostly sounds. You can find all credits on the <a class="link" href="./credits.html">aptly named page</a>, or by clicking the question mark button in the application bar on the right whenever it's there.</p>

            <p>If you see any bugs, wonder why I wrote things this way, have some advice about how I could write some better code or have some inquiries in general, feel free to contact me, either on GitHub or via email: <span><button id="email-button">click to reveal</button></span>.</p>
