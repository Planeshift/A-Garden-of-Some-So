            <h1>Credits</h1>

            <p>Most of the website was made by myself. However, some pages use resources that I did not make, and I always try to give attribution, even if it's not required, simply because others could wonder how I did things, would like to recreate them or simply use the same resources. Therefore, here is a list of credits, divided by areas.</p>

            <div class="credits-section">
                <h2>The Garden</h2>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The color palette was found using Color Hunt, because I'm a lazy boy and always have trouble creating good color palettes. You can find it <a class="link" href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/5f71616d8b74efead8d0c9c0">here</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <div class="credits-section">
                <h2>Flooding Tiles</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The bouncing "boing" sounds made by a square when appearing were made by plingativator and can be found <a class="link" href="https://freesound.org/people/plingativator/sounds/188869/">here</a>.</li>
                    <li>The popping sound made when a square disappear were made by ScratchnSniff and can be found <a class="link" href="https://freesound.org/people/ScratchnSniff/sounds/242113/">here</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>



            <div class="credits-section">
                <h2>Flower Wall</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The harp sounds were made using the VST "Etherealwinds Harp II: Community Edition" with Podium Free, a free DAW ; the VST file can be found <a class="link" href="https://vis.versilstudios.com/etherealwinds-harp.html">here</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            

            <div class="credits-section">
                <h2>Endless Night</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        While unfinished (life happens), the app still uses some music. You can find it <a class="link" href="http://pixabay.com/music/solo-piano-ambient-piano-prod-by-balancebay-109400/">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other sounds and stuff were used, like the Delaunator (that would have been used for constellations). I didn't track all of this properly, and I should. I'll try to do that whenever I get back to this project and finally finish it.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Shades</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This part was built using VueJS, Vite, Pinia and Tailwind in regards to major libraries. I used <a href="https://github.com/Qix-/color-convert" class="link">color-convert</a> to handle all conversions between RGBA and HSLA.
