            <h1>Credits</h1>

            <p>Most of the website was made by myself. However, some pages use resources that I did not make, and I always try to give attribution, even if it's not required, simply because others could wonder how I did things, would like to recreate them or simply use the same resources. Therefore, here is a list of credits, divided by areas.</p>

            <div class="credits-section">
                <h2>The Garden</h2>

                    <li>
                        The color palette was found using Color Hunt, because I'm a lazy boy and always have trouble creating good color palettes. You can find it <a class="link" href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/5f71616d8b74efead8d0c9c0">here</a>.
