    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>This whole website was made by me, Quentin Garcia, a french web developper, starting in May of 2022. The project can be found on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Planeshift/A-Garden-of-Some-Sort">A Garden Of Some Sort</a>.</p>

    <p>The point was to made small self-contained "apps" that could be used both as a demonstration of skill and to acquire new ones. But more important than that, I just wanted to make… things. Pretty and silly little webpages, akin to pages you can find on <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/">The Useless Web</a>, itself an impressive collection of pages that mostly do… well, useless things. Some are dumb, some are amusing, some are beautiful, some are informative, and most, if not all, are useless beyond a few seconds of distraction. But there is something profound in how much time and craft people will pour into making those few seconds, don't you think?</p>

    <p>Moving on from this sudden philosophical turn, here are some technical things that may interest you. </p>

    <p>This whole thing was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. You may notice that there are no frameworks nor specific dependecies, no SASS or LESS, no React or Vue or Angular, no jQuery, no Node.js. This is on-purpose: although I don't dislike them, using something like React to do most of what I'm doing would be rather useless. Rather than bloat the pages and their sizes, I only use what's necessary, and pretty much everything can be done in vanilla anyway, something people tend to forget. That doesn't mean future areas of the garden won't use any frameworks, as I indeed have some plans to use some of them from more complex things. But as of now, it's not necessary and won't make me gain any time nor productivity, so I don't use them.</p>

    <p>Most of what you can find of this website has been made by my little hands. However, there are exceptions, mostly sounds. You can find all credits on the <a href="./credits.html">aptly named page</a>, or by clicking the question mark button in the application bar on the right whenever it's there.</p>

    <p>If you see any bugs, wonder why I wrote things this way, have some advice about how I could write some better code or have some inquiries in general, feel free to contact me, either on GitHub or via email: <span><button id="email-button">click to reveal</button></span>.</p>
