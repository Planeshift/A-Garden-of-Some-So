    <h1>Credits</h1>

    <p>Most of the website was made by myself. However, some pages use resources that I did not make, and I always try to give attribution, even if it's not required, simply because others could wonder how I did things, would like to recreate them or simply use the same resources. Therefore, here is a list of credits, divided by areas.</p>

    <h2>Flooding Tiles</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The bouncing "boing" sounds made by a square when appearing were made by plingativator and can be found <a href="https://freesound.org/people/plingativator/sounds/188869/">here</a>.</li>
        <li>The popping sound made when a square disappear were made by ScratchnSniff and can be found <a href="https://freesound.org/people/ScratchnSniff/sounds/242113/">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Flower Wall</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The harp sounds were made using the VST "Etherealwinds Harp II: Community Edition" with Podium Free, a free DAW ; the VST file can be found <a href="https://vis.versilstudios.com/etherealwinds-harp.html">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
