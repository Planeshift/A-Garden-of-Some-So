Version 0.2 - 2022 05 29

Closer and closer to release, we are.

Only need to do some minor tweaks (CSS, redoing audio files) and next version should be the release.

- Changed the layout again, because I'm now using Gulp (only for the html includes). Built files are not included as of now, but I may do that, it's just very redundant.
- Includes are now set up for the navigation bar in the apps, the info modal, and the header on main pages. About time.
- Finally added the proper CSS for the about and credits pages.

Version 0.1 - 2022 05 27

Added this version file, that I will surely forget to update.

This will be used instead of commits when I do large changes and forget to commit each change as it comes along.

Anyway, here's a list of changes, in no particular order:

- Changed the layout and organization. Files are now organized much closer to what I want them to be in the end. This may change again.
- Added a homepage, an about page and a credits page (still WIP on all three)
- Added volume controls
- Added a volume.js file that handles volume controls
- Added a home button
- Added a credits button
- Flower wall has been finished, with harp sounds!
- Minor changes and fixes to flooding tiles
